-- Return linear_feature_id of streams that likely leave BC
-- Includes streams bordering Yukon, NWT, Alberta, Montana, Idaho, Washington

-- NOTES:
-- - this does not currently include Alaska
-- - we do not use the official border as it does not precisely follow 49/60/120
--   (but the FWA edges generally do)
-- - presumes no streams span the AB/BC continental divide portion of border
-- - it could be valuable to manually QA the results and generate a lookup of all
--   BC streams that exit the province rather than approximating in this way
