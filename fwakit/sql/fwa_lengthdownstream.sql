-- fwa_lengthdownstream(blue_line_key, downstream_route_measure, padding)

-- Return sum of length of stream downstream of a point represented by
-- a blue line key and a downstream route measure

-- Note 1
-- All segments that are referancable on the network are included -
-- everything with a local watershed code. This will include side channels,
-- lake construction lines, subsurface flow - anything that has a local code.

-- Note 2
-- The function only sums the lenght of streams present in the database. Any
-- stream flow outside of BC will not be included in the total.

-- Note 3
-- The function will not return anything if provided  a location that does not
-- have a local code - this cannot be referenced on the network
