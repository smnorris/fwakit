-- fwa_downstreamlength_recursive()

-- Return length of stream downstream of a point, given blue_line_key and
-- downstream_route_measure.
-- Note that this returns side channels/distributaries as well as main-stems.

-- Downstream query is recursive SQL adapted from:
-- http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2010/07/network-walking-in-postgis.html

-- Due to its recursive nature, this function will only work when used with
-- the stream network and is provided for reference/proof of concept only.
-- Use fwa_downstreamlength() instead.
