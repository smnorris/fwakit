-- Find stream slope at point, over specified *total* length about point (m)

-- This function calls fwa_slope(blue_line_key, measure1, measure2), but
-- ensures that the measures used are within the length of the stream -
-- intervals that correspond to measures shorter or longer than the stream are
-- shifted to fall at the start/end of the line (the length of the interval
-- is preserved).

-- For example, on a hypothetical stream blue_line_key=99999 over a 100m
-- interval:

-- Basic case, no shift:
--   fwa_intervalslope(99999, 350, 100)  ==  fwa_slope(99999, 300, 400)

-- Provided interval would result in measure < 0, shifted to start at 0:
--   fwa_intervalslope(99999, 20, 100)  ==  fwa_slope(99999, 0, 100)

-- Interval starts at 0, no shift:
--   fwa_intervalslope(99999, 50, 100)  ==  fwa_slope(99999, 0, 100)

-- Interval would fall outside maximum length of stream, shifted to finish
-- at end of line while preserving length of interval:
--   fwa_intervalslope(99999, 980, 100)  ==  fwa_slope(99999, 950, 100)
